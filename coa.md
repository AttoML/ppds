COURSE OF ACTION

To Start with, The obvious choice would be to start learning Statistics. If you consider refreshing the concepts, start with exploring  StatisticsHowTo. It covers a vast array of definitions and simple explanations. If you want all that webpages compiled in a book, use The Practically Cheating Statistics Handbook (2010) Deviant S .

Decide if you are
The BOOKS Person or rather The TUTORIALS Person

IF you are the Books Person begin with
1.	ISLR - An Introduction to Statistical Learning, Gareth M. James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani [Link]

2.	Probability & Statistics for Engineers & Scientists Keying Ye, Ronald Walpole, and Sharon L. Myers [Link]

IF you are the Tutorials Person begin with
Khan Academy’s Statistics and probability Tutorials
1)	[Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1328115D3D8A2566)
2)	[Probability](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC58778F28211FA19)
To intuitively and visually understand stat let alone theoretically, start with 
3)	[Josh Starmer’s Statquest](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9)

Heading into Linear Algebra
Consider Following
1)	[Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyAuNHPsq-g&list=PLFD0EB975BA0CC1E0)
2)	[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

Then stepping into Machine Learning
I’d rather suggest  
1)	Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, Aurélien Géron [Link]
2)	Python Machine Learning, Sebastian Raschka [Link]

Random Advice
Whenever you feel stuck with grasping any concepts, try googling those concepts with Medium or Towards Data Science blogs where people give you a crisp walk through and abstract idea of the very concept.
